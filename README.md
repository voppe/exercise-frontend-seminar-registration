This is an interview exercise to test my frontend skills.
The objective was to simulate the behaviour of the UI shown in `form.webm` as closely as possible, starting completely from scratch and without tool restriction.
To see it in action just [download the .zip](https://github.com/voppe/exercise-frontend-seminar-registration/archive/master.zip), extract and open `index.html`
